All of these are optional, and can be left with their default value (empty string, `''`) to disable the Discord integration.

- For *sending* in-game messages to Discord, at minimum `ServerConfig.DiscordWebhookId` and `ServerConfig.DiscordWebhookToken` must be set.
- For *receiving* messages from Discord and displaying them in-game, at minimum `ServerConfig.DiscordBotToken` and `ServerConfig.DiscordChannel` must be set.

The ID and token of a Discord webhook can be found from the URL: `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/<id>/<token>`

## Staff channel

The `ServerConfig.StaffChannelAce` variable in [server/config.lua](server/config.lua) defines the ace that determines which players can access the Staff channel. By default, it is `chat.staffChannel`.

If you add/remove the ace for players while the server is running, you must run `poodlechat_refresh_perms` or restart the resource to apply the changes.

## Roles

Roles are labels that appear next to a player's name in chat, such as "Admin" or "Moderator". Each role is associated with an ace, so that any players with that ace will receive that role. Optionally, each role can be given a colour that overrides the default local and global chat colours for names.

The list of available roles is configured in [server/config.lua](server/config.lua).

Example:

```
Config.Roles = {
    {name = 'Admin', ace = 'chat.admin'},
    {name = 'Moderator', color = {0, 255, 0}, ace = 'chat.moderator'}
}
```

In `server.cfg`:

```
add_ace group.admin chat.admin allow
add_ace group.moderator chat.moderator allow
```

## Execute commands from Discord

To enable executing commands from the Discord channel, you must:

1. Add principals for the Discord IDs of all Discord users that can execute commands.

2. Grant those principals the ace defined in `ServerConfig.ExecuteCommandsAce`.

3. Grant the poodlechat resource any aces needed to execute the desired commands.

Example:

```
# Add Discord users as moderators
add_principal identifier.discord:123456789 group.moderator
add_principal identifier.discord:987654321 group.moderator

# Allow moderators to execute commands from Discord
add_ace group.moderator chat.executeCommands

# Specify which commands can be used from Discord
add_ace resource.poodlechat command.kick allow
add_ace resource.poodlechat command.ban allow
```

You will then be able to prefix messages with `!` in the channel specified in `ServerConfig.DiscordChannel` to have them executed as commands on the server:

```
!kick "Some Player" "Get outta here!"
```

The following variables in [server/config.lua](server/config.lua) control aspects of executing commands from Discord:

| Variable                        | Description                                                             |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ServerConfig.ExecuteCommandsAce | The ace that allows executing commands from Discord.                    |
| ServerConfig.ChatCommandPrefix  | The prefix used in Discord chat to execute a command.                   |
| ServerConfig.DeleteChatCommands | Whether to automatically delete chat commands from the Discord channel. |
